<h1 id="i-ran-a-computer-font-making-workshop">I ran a computer font-making workshop!</h1>

<p>Last week I ran a computer font-making workshop at the hackspace. It was a bunch of fun, and I really enjoyed seeing the creativity come out of people via the medium of creating typefaces :)</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/making-bogface/">I like fonts</a></p>

<h2 id="who-where-when">Who, Where, When?</h2>

<p>I ran the workshop at the hackspace. I’d seen that we had run workshops before on knife-making and other things, and I thought it would be neat if I did something similarly collective. Often, people are together at the hackspace, which I <a href="https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/what-is-a-third-space/">enjoy in and of itself</a>. But, it is extra neat if people can be together and all be working on similar things.</p>

<p>About three or four weeks ago, I decided to just “do it”, and I made up a sign and put it up in the space.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2024-03-09-font-workshop/workshop-sign.jpg" alt="Hand-drawn sign saying &quot;font making workshop&quot;" /></p>

<figcaption>

Some have pointed out an irony that a poster for a computer font workshop was handwritten...

</figcaption>

<p>As far as I was concerned, “a workshop” is not really an established idea. But that’s part of the reason I like community spaces like the hackspace: I can pretend something is an established idea and people will believe it is.</p>

<p>I didn’t start with a great plan, but rather started by motivating myself to create a plan (by putting up the poster). This turned out to be a nice method of motivation, as I had set a date for my “workshop”, which forced me to consider what a “workshop” would involve.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-a-workshop-involve">What does a workshop involve?</h2>

<p>I ended up giving a short presentation about why I like fonts, some things to think about when designing a font, and an overview of how to use FontForge, which is the program <a href="https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/making-bogface/">that I made BogFace in</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-presentation">The presentation</h3>

<p>I thought about using Google Slides to make a presentation. However, you can’t use custom fonts, which was… kind of a killer for a font workshop.</p>

<p>I went with <a href="https://revealjs.com/">RevealJS</a>, which I had seen one of my computer-loving lecturers use at university. It’s quite neat to use, mainly because everything is written in HTML. I guess I am fate-bound to never use a WYSIWYG editor again.</p>

<p>The presentation is hosted at <a href="https://alifeee.co.uk/font-workshop/">https://alifeee.co.uk/font-workshop/</a>, but since it is a website, I can also embed it here! Have a scuttle around (press space to <del>slow down</del> progress.)</p>

<iframe src="https://alifeee.co.uk/font-workshop/" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; min-height: 20rem"></iframe>

<figcaption>

If I do another workshop in the future, I will probably update this a bit, and this embed would change :)

</figcaption>

<h2 id="what-people-made">What people made</h2>

<p>I helped five people make their own fonts. Each one went about it quite (or slightly, depending on how much you care about fonts) differently.</p>

<p>No method was wrong. Some methods were slower, fostering - I think - more appreciation for digital graphic work. All methods were very creative, and it was great to see different ways people went about making a font.</p>

<p>Described briefly, and each description written in their own font, here are the ways people created their fonts:</p>

<p>(Some are incomplete. Some will be updated as time passes.)</p>

<div class="font--classic-neil">
<h3>Auto-traced handwriting</h3>
<p>
  Tanya¹ did what many designate the "classic move" in font-making: they made a handwriting font.
</p>
<p>
  The method was to draw the letters a through z on paper and take a picture of it. Then, each letter was isolated into a bitmap image of each letter. [potrace](https://potrace.sourceforge.net/) was used to convert the bitmap images into SVG images, which were then imported into FontForge, where they could be resized and moved around to look good.
</p>
</div>

<div class="font--font">
<h3>Manually traced hand-designed letters</h3>
<p>
  Ivanka¹ drew some guidelines on paper, and designed and drew block letters on the sheet. Then, they took a picture of the hand-drawn letters and digitised them manually, using the vector tools in FontForge.
</p>
</div>

<div class="font--vmorse">
<h3>Designed a Morse code font</h3>
<p>
  Dragomir¹ designed a Morse font. You are reading it now.
</p>
</div>

<div class="font--a-font">
<h3>Digitally designed letter forms</h3>
<p>
  Katya¹ designed their letter forms entirely digitally, within FontForge. After a few, they were able to copy stylistic parts of letters to other letters, such as the caps of "b" and "d".
</p>
</div>

<div class="font--ricardo">
<h3>Stroke-expanded lines drawn via touchscreen</h3>
<p>
  Tomislav¹ used their touchscreen laptop to draw the letters with a single stroke, and then used FontForge's ["Expand Stroke"](https://fontforge.org/docs/techref/stroke.html) to turn the one-dimensional drawings into two-dimensional vector shapes.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="id-love-to-do-another-workshop">I’d love to do another workshop!</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun helping people make fonts, through thinking about design to how to practically using tools. It was very interesting and cool to me that each person involved made their font differently.</p>

<p>In terms of how I ran it, and my presentation, I have some ideas of how to make things clearer and easier to understand.</p>

<p>It was very fun to do, and I’d love to run another font workshop!</p>

We can see where holes should be, but only from the inside.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4817_resize.jpg" alt="" />
Cut a piece out of an old plastic milk carton, to fit inside the box</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4819_resize.jpg" alt="" />
Fold the plastic and add a thin layer of BluTac (other colours are available)</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4821_resize.jpg" alt="" />
Press the plastic strip and BluTac onto the sockets to make an impression</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4825_resize.jpg" alt="" />
Carefully remove the plastic strip</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4827_resize.jpg" alt="" />
Position a bradawl in the centre of each hole and push through both layers of plastic</p>

Re-attach the BluTac in EXACTLY the same impressions you made previously. Accuracy depends upon it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4824_resize.jpg" alt="" />

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-07-17-align-holes-in-your-project-box-without-measuring-no-special-tools-required/IMG_4832_resize.jpg" alt="" />
Ensure the circuit board is in the correct postion, and press the strip onto outside of the box</p>

<p>Use the bradawl to mark the drill centres
Yes it’s just that simple. This method worked first time for me. If you are unsure, drill the -holes a bit smaller and file them out to be in the correct place.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s useful to know the activity on the GPIO pins of your microcontroller. This little monitor board is designed specifically for the Wemos D1 mini and has a LED on each GPIO pin to help you visualise what is happening on inputs and outputs.</p>

<div class="responsive-iframe-container">
	<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1M6AZlkAoDQ?feature=oembed"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Microcontroller boards other than the D1 mini can be accommodated by either re-designing the layout for the extra pins, or using extension leads to monitor those pins you are interested in.</p>

<p>LEDs can be disconnected by removing the jumper links, so as not to interfere with other functions. All LED series resistors deliberately have a high value to minimise loading the GPIO pins. The white LEDs drew less than 500 microamps each when used with a 1K series resistor, and they were still quite bright.</p>

General view showing breakout header sockets, header pins, and jumpers.</p>

<p>The monitor can also act as a small breakout board, extending the Wemos header pins to 2 sockets and 2 pins per GPIO line. This can be handy when developing your project, as Dupont extension leads could be used to connect the monitor board to your PCB.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-06-16-wemos-d1-mini-gpio-test-board/Wemos-Led-Board-3-1024x461.jpg" alt="" />
Wemos D1 mini and the breakout test board.</p>

<p>Construction is simple – besides the header pins and sockets, there are just a dozen SMD resistors and LEDs, mounted on a prototyping board. The underside of the board is where the connections were made, linking pins with single strands taken from a length of scrap multistrand wire.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-06-16-wemos-d1-mini-gpio-test-board/Wemos-Led-Board-4-1024x490.jpg" alt="" />
Underside showng the link wires and SMD resistors.</p>

<p>The video shows the board with jumpers installed for all 9 GPIO ports (D0 to D8). Due to high value series resistors, the LEDs do not interfere with program uploading, and if you install the RX and TX jumpers you can watch the LEDs giving a satisfying twinkle with the upload activity.</p>]]></content><author><name>Richard Langner</name></author><category term="Arduino" /><category term="Electronics Articles" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visualise Active Ports]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Minecraft auto mouse spin wheel</title><link href="https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/minecraft-auto-mouse-spin-wheel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Minecraft auto mouse spin wheel" /><published>2020-06-13T20:01:23+00:00</published><updated>2020-06-13T20:01:23+00:00</updated><id>https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/minecraft-auto-mouse-spin-wheel</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/minecraft-auto-mouse-spin-wheel/"><![CDATA[<p>When you are building creations in Minecraft, sometimes you need to have random blocks placed down from you hotbar.

<p>THE PROBLEM — You’ve made the electronics part of your project, and now need to cut a hole in your project box so you can plug in the USB cable. But how do you know where to cut? Unless the box is transparent, you can’t see exactly where the USB socket hole should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/VK4zoUrNhkQ">There is a short (2:40) video of this post here.</a></p>

<p>Update: At the bottom of this post, there are links showing how to locate drill centres WITHOUT any tools.</p>

Hole is in exactly the right place. and allows for plug housing</p>

Micro USB plug fits neatly</p>

<p>The usual way is to measure the internal position of the USB socket when the PCB is fully in the box (not always possible) and transfer the measurements to the outside of the box. You have to be able measure and mark accurately.</p>

PCB ready to fit into the project box.</p>

<p>This little tool provides a drilling and cutting guide on the <strong>outside</strong> of the box, when the USB socket is on the <strong>inside</strong> of the box (possibly hidden from view). No measuring is required.</p>

Align the two strips</p>

<p>My design is quite simple. Overlay two strips and fix them together at one end – similar to tweezers. The strips staddle the wall of the project box, one strip inside the box, the other outside. The inner strip is fixed into the USB socket, and the outer strip has guide marks for the required opening.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-03-15-perfectly-aligned-holes-without-measuring/Hole-cutting-template-08-1024x831.jpg" alt="" />
Thin yellow inner strip is clamped in position.</p>

<p><strong>The inner strip</strong> — should be reasonably thin so it can fit between the PCB and the box. I cut a 10mm wide strip off an old credit card, narrowed it at one end to make a tab that fits snugly into the USB socket, then bent the tab 90 degrees (warming helps but is not essential).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020-03-15-perfectly-aligned-holes-without-measuring/Hole-cutting-template-09-1024x683.jpg" alt="" />
Line up the outer strip’s tab with the drill holes.</p>

<p><strong>The outer strip</strong> — should be stiff transparent material. At one end, mark where the cut-lines and drill holes should be for the USB socket. Align the inner strip’s tab with the outer strip’s markings, then fasten them together at the other end. That’s it!</p>

Fit tab into the USB socket</p>

<p>USAGE — To use the template, insert the tab into the USB socket and slide the circuit board and the inner strip into the box. Ensure the outer strip is flat to the outside of the box and use the cutting guides to mark the box. My original marks were the drill-centres for a couple of 6mm holes. Use a drill press for accuracy, and a small file to smooth and adjust the drilled holes to the final shape.</p>

Slide the PCB and the tool into the project box.</p>

Mark through the drill pilot holes</p>

<p>This technique will work on plastic or metal, and can be adapted for any shape of socket and hole. Draw the marking guide to accept the largest plug you may use.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION —</strong></p>

<p>Cutting holes in the right place is something I have always struggled with. I have to admit I was amazed when this worked first time!</p>

I needed a new bag for my Brompton bike. All the bags were very expensive, £70 for the basic bags so I did what any maker would do and started on the journey to make my own bag. There was a few challenges:</p>

<p>1 . Find a way to connect the bag to the front carrier block securely.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find a cheaper bag that i could modify easily and thats water proof</li>
  <li>Work out if anything else was need, e.g. bag strengthening.</li>
</ol>

<p>I started by look on thingiverse for 3D printed Brampton carrier block, its always a good place to start to see how other people have attacked the problem. I didn’t find anything. I set work to design one myself using fusion 360 – Matt SB gave me a helping hand to get started with as its the first functional 3d object I’ve printed. I came up with the item below after a few iterations printed on my Aldi 3D printer.</p>

front carrier block.</p>

<p>The next challenge was to find a bag. I search on the internet and i <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32821377430.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dTXnN7t">purchased a bag from aliexpress for £4</a> to test the process out. The test went fine and I used the bag for about a year but the wear and tear took its toll on the bag so I bought a better quality bag from decathlon shown below. This is the bag that i will describe on the rest of the blog.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2019-08-22-brompton-bag/brompton-1024x498.jpg" alt="" />
I’ve got the carrier block designed and the water proof bag. Now I need to attach everything and make sure it wont damage the bike/contents of the bag. The back board in the bag was a bit bendy and I’m carrying my laptop to and from work so I wanted it to get there and back in one piece. To strengthen the back I bought a A3 clear polycarbonate makrolon plastic panel Sheet 3mm thick from ebay. This went down the back of the bag to strengthen it. I sawed it to shape to start with and then bent it using the hot gun in the hackspace. This gave the bottom of the bag something solid so the laptop or other items in the bag wouldn’t sag and hit the front wheel. I also added some neoprene foam to the bottom of the plastic sheet to cushion any items put in the bag.</p>

The next task was to attach the bag to front carrier block. I did this using a hand drill and screwed it together.</p>

I wanted a separate area for the bag.</p>]]></content><author><name>Alex Kelly</name></author><category term="Uncategorized" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I needed a new bag for my Brompton bike.

<p>Here’s the setup:</p>

<p>An arduino (pro mini) for controlling the SG-90 servo motor<br />
An ESP8266 for wifi access and neopixel control<br />
A piece of gutter and downpipe for the main body<br />
A plastic dome sourced from a solar powered garden lamp<br />
An Aldi’s peanut butter jam jar lid (crucial)<br />
Other bits and bobs scrounged from various unwanted poundland items</p>
