All visitors and members are welcome to come along to our open evenings:

{% include calendar.md %}

We are located very close to the Sheffield United ground and occasionally Saturday sessions clash with match days. This can make access more difficult. You can check the home fixtures list [here](https://fixtur.es/en/team/sheffield-united-fc/home).

Key holders can let themselves in whenever they want for 24/7 access.
