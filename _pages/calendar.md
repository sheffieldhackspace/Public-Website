Key holding members can let themselves in whenever they want for 24/7 access, and all members and visitors are welcome to come along to our scheduled meetings:

* Monday 6 - 9 pm
* Thursday 6 - 9 pm
* Saturday 2 -6 pm

We are located very close to the Sheffield United ground and occasionally saturday sessions clash with match days. This can make access more dificult. You can check the home fixtures list [here](https://fixtur.es/en/team/sheffield-united-fc/home).
