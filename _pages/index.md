Simply put, we're a [maker-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace). Together we're helping the people of Sheffield get involved in using tools for hobby projects in fields such as electronics, wood-working, textiles, machining and anything else you're interested in.

We’re always keen for people with a wide range of interests and skill levels to join, swap ideas, learn from each other, and build new things.

We’re open every Saturday (2pm-6pm), Monday (6pm-9pm) and Thursday (6pm-9pm), to prospective members and, membership is affordable from £6 a month.
