Sheffield Hackspace is a non-profit, member-run hackspace for central Sheffield. Together we’re building a workshop and community to help people in Sheffield get involved in “the creative use of technology and tools for hobby-scale projects in fields such as computers, robotics, machining, technology, science, digital art or electronic art“.

We’re interested in whatever our members are interested in! We currently have members interested in electronics, 3D printing and CAD, textiles, woodwork and metalwork, crafts, photography, high altitude ballooning… Some of these projects get highlighted on this site, but there’s no substitute for coming along to meet the group.

Being a Do-ocracy, decisions are taken by those who choose to get involved and do the making. We’re always keen for people with a wide range of interests and skill levels to join, swap ideas, learn from each other, and build new things.

We’re open every Saturday (2pm-6pm), Monday (6pm-9pm) and Thursday (6pm-9pm), to prospective members.
