Simply put, we're a [maker-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace). Together we're helping the people of Sheffield get involved in using tools for hobby projects in fields such as electronics, wood-working, textiles, machining and anything else you're interested in.

We’re always keen for people with a wide range of interests and skill levels to join, swap ideas, learn from each other, and build new things.

We have several open evenings every week to give folks who may be interested in what we do - and what facilities we can provide - a chance to come and have a look round and meet some of our members. All are welcome to all nights. If you have ever wondered what a "hackspace" is, or if you like to create, make or craft things, come and pay us a visit! Current open evenings are:

After visiting, membership starts from £10 a month.
