If you’re interested in what we do, get in touch below or just come along and join in!

Drop in to one of our scheduled meetings to meet us in person and see the Hackspace. We are located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/aZR2bM7N73FBo6pf9) in portland works.

Joining costs as little as £6 a month for the three sessions a week and £21 a month for a key so you can come and go as you please.

If you have any questions before you come along you can email us at [trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk](mailto:trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk).
