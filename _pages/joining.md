If youâ€™re interested in what we do, get in touch below or just come along and join in!

Drop in anytime to one of our open evenings to get a feel of the Hackspace and see how things work:

{% include calendar.md %}

After visiting, membership is available at:

<!-- information from _config.yml -->
<!-- HTML as if markdown, it gets wrapped in <p> -->
<ul>
    {% for plan in site.membership_plans %}
    <li>
        {{plan.currency_symbol}}{{plan.value}} {{plan.billing_interval}} to {{plan.description}} ({{plan.name}})
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

If you have any questions before you come along you can email us at [trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk](mailto:trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk).
