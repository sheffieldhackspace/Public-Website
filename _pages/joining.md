After visiting, a membership costs £6 a month to regularly attend the open evenings, or £21 a month for a key, allowing you to come and go as you please.

If you have any questions before you come along you can email us at [trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk](mailto:trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk).

We are located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/EcVTWfknJ8XSRYax9) in Portland Works. Find the green door at the top of Randall Street S2 4SJ, and press the call button. We are in the courtyard on the ground floor.
