If you’re interested in what we do, get in touch below or just come along and join in!

Drop in to one of our scheduled meetings to meet us in person and see the Hackspace. Alternatively, email us at [trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk](mailto:trustees@sheffieldhackspace.org.uk).

“We make whatever our members want to make”, so don’t hesitate to get in contact with us or come on down to one of our scheduled meets. We always welcome newcomers, no matter age, ability or knowledge of skills. We are a place to Make, Share and Learn new skills.

Joining costs as little as £6 a month for the three sessions a week and £21 a month for a key so you can come and go as you please.
