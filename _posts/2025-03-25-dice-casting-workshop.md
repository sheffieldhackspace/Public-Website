Last month Alex taught three of us how to make silicone moulds, mix resin, and make our own dice!

Alex has been trying out casting techniques for dice for a while on his own, and shared his knowledge with us by organising a hands-on workshop where we could try it out.

The moulding process started with making a silicone mould of an existing dice. We chose to use dice from our personal collections, but just as easily could have used a 3D printed blank. This mould needs somewhere to pour the resin eventually, so we attached "sprues" to our dice which – when taken out – would form the negative space of a funnel.

Then, we mixed together silicone by mixing equal-mass "Part A" and "Part B". Once mixed, we each had 8 minutes to make all of our moulds.
