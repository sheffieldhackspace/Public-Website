Busy times here at SHH&amp;M! A few snapshots of things our members have been working on recently in the hackspace:

[![Project Snapshots](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tiles.png)](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tiles.png)

Some of the stuff we’ve been up to lately includes:

- Upgrading one of our 3D printers
- Building comfy deckchairs for slow afternoons in the coutyard
- Ultra-lightweight aircraft for indoor flying
- Building and upgrading our network and servers
- Running workshops, including [amazing ice-cream!](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/2015/05/experimental-foods-day/)
- Arduino and ESP8266 programming
- Prototyping a pocket-sized (taking-to-the-pub-sized!) boardgame
- Learning woodworking and joinery
- …plus our high altitude balloon project, catching up with friends and being inspired by cool projects at the [Halifax Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfairehalifax.com/), further work on our RFID entry system, and a hundred other things that I don’t have photos of.
