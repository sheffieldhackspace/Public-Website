Iâ€™ve been research designing circuit boards design and tried a few different such as eagle, ki cad and came across easyEDA which is perfect for newbies like myself. Its simple to use, the SMC (Surface mount components) selection is all tied in. You can order a PCB and have all the component (well most of them) soldered at the manufacture JCL without you have to do any soldering at all! Take a look at the video below for a quick demo
