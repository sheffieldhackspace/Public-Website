[![Janine at Halifax](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sheffield1-199x300.jpg)](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sheffield1.jpg)

Aaron (of [Oomlout](http://oomlout.co.uk/) fame), interviewed SHH&amp;M member and trustee [Janine](https://twitter.com/j9kirby) about our hackspace and what we do here. It’s a nice writeup, with Janine giving a great introduction to our group and a few of the projects that we took along to the Halifax Mini Maker Faire. [You can read the interview, and see some nice photos of the projects we took to Halifax, here](http://oomlout.co.uk/blogs/news/30652993-focus-on-sheffield-hardware-hackers-makers-janine-kirby).

As ever: if you’re interested in what we do, [get in touch](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/contact-us/), or look at the [calendar](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/calendar/) and just turn up to a meeting to meet us.
