SHH&amp;M are proud to announce that we’re officially incorporated as a company! We’re a member-run, non-profit Community Interest Company, with the mission of **“helping people in Sheffield to make creative use of technology and tools for hobby-scale projects in fields such as computers, machining, technology, science, and digital or electronic art”**.

More simply, we’re a [Hackspace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) for Sheffield.

These are very early days for us, but if you’re interested [get in touch](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/?page_id=443)!

At the moment, we’re busy renovating our new home in the [Portland Works](http://www.portlandworks.co.uk/) in central Sheffield. Our first proper public events will be very soon!
