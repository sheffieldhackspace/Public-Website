On Friday October 23rd we took part in [MAKE:SHIFT:DO](http://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/makeshiftdo/). A creative open day run by the [Craft Council](http://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/). Also taking part at Portland Works was James Wallbank who was doing Laser Cutting tutorials.

We displayed a number of our ongoing projects and had a few interested parties. Photos below.

[Portland Works](http://www.portlandworks.co.uk) was the only location in Sheffield to be taking part in MAKE:SHIFT:DO this year and 1 of only 4 locations in Yorkshire as a whole.

We hope to run a similar (if not much, much better) event next year.
