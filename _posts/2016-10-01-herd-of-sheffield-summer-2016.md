<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans Condensed;">Earlier in the summer, a herd of elephants descended on Sheffield. Of the 58 in total, a few of particular interest are shown below. Each has been individually designed by nationally and internationally known artists. Having been on show, they will be auctioned off in October to raise funds for the Artfelt programme which is involved painting the artwork on the walls of the Sheffield Children’s Hospital as well as running workshops for kids. And why elephants? 100 years ago, during the First World War, Lizzie the elephant was employed to move heavy loads across the city, as all the horses had been enrolled in the military. </span>

<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans Condensed;">Catch the Herd of Sheffield on the streets of the city till 5 October</span>
