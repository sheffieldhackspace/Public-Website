In a recent donation to the hackspace there was a [CanonScan FB630U](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/scanners/support-scanners-canoscan-series/canoscan-fb-630u) A4 flatbed scanner and I thought that it could be useful to create a shared network scanner for use by the members.

This plan was gainfully assisted by a spare 256MB Raspberry Pi B, 16GB SD card, power supply &amp; PiBow Raspberry Pi case.

## Raspberry Pi setup

Start by downloading the newest versions of [Rasbian Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest) from the Raspberry Pi website.

Flash the Raspbian image onto the SD card using your tool of choice. Iâ€™m mostly using [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) right now as it verifies after flashing.

## Finished result
