## How to cut a hole to mate up with what’s inside your project box.

THE PROBLEM — You’ve made the electronics part of your project, and now need to cut a hole in your project box so you can plug in the USB cable. But how do you know where to cut? Unless the box is transparent, you can’t see exactly where the USB socket hole should be. [There is a short (2:40) video of this post here.](https://youtu.be/VK4zoUrNhkQ)  
  
Update: At the bottom of this post, there are links showing how to locate drill centres WITHOUT any tools.

You have to be able measure and mark accurately.

No measuring is required.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hole-cutting-template-07-1024x970.jpg)<figcaption>Align the two strips</figcaption></figure>My design is quite simple. Overlay two strips and fix them together at one end – similar to tweezers. The strips staddle the wall of the project box, one strip inside the box, the other outside. The inner strip is fixed into the USB socket, and the outer strip has guide marks for the required opening.

I cut a 10mm wide strip off an old credit card, narrowed it at one end to make a tab that fits snugly into the USB socket, then bent the tab 90 degrees (warming helps but is not essential).

At one end, mark where the cut-lines and drill holes should be for the USB socket. Align the inner strip’s tab with the outer strip’s markings, then fasten them together at the other end. That’s it!

Ensure the outer strip is flat to the outside of the box and use the cutting guides to mark the box. My original marks were the drill-centres for a couple of 6mm holes. Use a drill press for accuracy, and a small file to smooth and adjust the drilled holes to the final shape.

Draw the marking guide to accept the largest plug you may use.

I have to admit I was amazed when this worked first time!
