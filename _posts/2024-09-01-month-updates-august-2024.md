## Matthew - 3D Printed Trophy

Matthew used the 3D printer to make a custom trophy for a fighting game tournament.

## Rich - Ethernet stringing

> In an effort to save money, I watched what the electrician did for the first fix for power cable and mimicked it with the much safer cat6 cable.
> I ran 2 cables each from each study in my extension after the flooring was built but before plastering in a star configuration back to where the router is in the old part of the house.
> 
> Installing a back box in an existing brick wall and running cable under the house will be a lot more difficult!

## alifeee - upholstery and rag-rugging

I've recently upholstered the cushion of a chair, and next is the back.
I bought some foam from the foam shop in Sheffield that is unfortunately closing down :(, and wrapped it loosely in fabric using the sewing machine at the hackspace.
Next, I need to pin it to the back of the chair.
It'll be a little harder than the cushion, as with that there was a place to hide my shoddy pinning (underneath the chair)

I've also hemmed a large piece of hessian which I plan to make into a large rag rug.
I think that will take a... long time.

## Harvey and Alex M - making a guitar

> We laser cut some MDF templates, and used them to cut out and start routing a strat-style electric guitar body, from a slab of paulownia wood.

## Nik - Computer Visuals

> I've been developing a workflow with TOOLL3, an open source real time audio visual software originally developed for use in demoscene.
> Its quite rough around the edges but very fun to play with and experiment.
> I've been doing projection experiments in the Hackspace courtyard and testing out a bunch of different effects recently, getting ready to do a full 1 minute sequence for the Minute Map event at MAPP festival in Montreal.
> These are some of my experiments so far.

Real time test with OSC data sync from VCV Rack (an open source eurorack emulation software for modular electronic music)

## Stuart - picture framing

> I recently went on a picture framing course and picked up a 2nd hand framing mortise guillotine.
> Since then I’ve been looking out for interesting things to frame as practice.
> I’ve had the 2 Happy Toast images, Frankie Boyle and The Young Ones, for a while and the Milky Way image is from Devon where we go on holiday.

## alifeee - making a video game

This month I participated in the [GMTK 2024 gamejam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024) with some friends, and we made a game about creating and climbing a tower.
I spent most of my time making the online leaderboard and implementing some movement mechanics.

You can play it in your browser here! <https://jman9092.itch.io/summon-to-scale>

or see my leaderboard on <https://summon2scale.alifeee.co.uk/>

## Alex K - Cursor AI code editor

> I've recently used Cursor, an AI code editor to create a complex full stack web development in language and app stack I haven't used before and the workflow made it easy.
> This video is a recording of the features and thoughts of my first few months of using Cursor.
> It feels very familiar if you are used to VSCode, as it is a fork of VSCode, also meaning that most plugins for VSCode work the same in Cursor.
> 
> Cursor uses Machine Learning in a way that I find to be a very intuitive workflow to help write code with just English.
> Of course you can also write and edit the code but you often dont need to.
> 
> I find it helps if you need to code for your project but dont know how to code or just need a productivity boost.
