## We opened up a gift box from Pimoroni

[Pimoroni](https://pimoroni.com/) gave us a box of electronics goodies and we spent an evening looking through it to see what ideas of RGB LED or sensing nature we could think of!

## Nik - modular origami

[Nik](https://twitter.com/NNNenov) has been folding [Sonobe modules](https://www.polypompholyx.com/2017/01/modularorigami/).

## Rich - living hinges

Rich has used a fascinating laser-cutting technique called a "living hinge" to create a laser-cut book cover! To create the hinge, they used the Inkscape extension: <https://inkscape.org/~drphonon/%E2%98%85living-hinge-creator-for-inkscape-10>

## Jonathan - wood turning

Jonathan has been using the wood lathe to create gonk bottle openers and turned pots.

## Richard - blinking LEDs

Richard has made a library for Arduino or ESP which blinks out any number from 0 to 99999 on the inbuilt LED.

From <https://github.com/RichardLangner/BlinkDigits>

> For example 390 is blinked as  
> 3 brief flashes,  
> 9 brief flashes,  
> 0 (one long flash).  

## Stephen - hand-made plane

Stephen has hand-made a dovetailed wood plane.

## Alex - robotic arm

[Alex](https://x.com/alex_paul_kelly) has been playing with robotics and has made their own robotic arm!

> My goal is to build a robotic arm to automate tasks at home and work. I'm passionate about the intersection of the physical and virtual worlds. While robotic arms have been around for a while, advancements in control methods are transforming the field. This project marks my first step in building and controlling a robotic arm.

## alifeee - rag rug

Inspired by [Liverpool Makefest](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/liverpool-makefest-2024/) last month, I found a latch hook at an antiques shop in Sheffield, and made a small rag rug as an experiment. I think it's neat :) I might try and make a much bigger one (no more throwing away fabrics!), which will take... a lot longer.

## Rich - vertical pen plotter

Inspired by a project in the Hackspace magazine, Rich bought a few motors, some electronics, and a Raspberry Pi Zero, and put it together into a vertical pen plotter. The hardware is all set up, now it's just waiting on the software working!

## Alex - plants

Alex has been propagating the spider plants in the space, and has made a nursery for baby plants out of a falafel salad lid, laser cut Perspex and decorative cardboard.
