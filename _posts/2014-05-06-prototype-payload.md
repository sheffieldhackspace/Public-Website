As you may already know, the Sheffield Hardware Hackers and Makers group are participating in a High Altitude Balloon launch. We have been busy at the “Hack Shack” making preparations for a kite test flight. Witch is why it has been quite around hear.

 All the different parts that group members have created are being bundled up in to a small polystyrene box and are taking flight via a kite. However there are still some parts witch need to be sorted. A half build day and half field day has been proposed. The theory is that we will spend half a day at Access Space adding the final hardware components to the prototype, then the plan is to drive down to Graves Park with radios, laptops, 3G Dongle ext… and conduct some proper field testing.

This is going to help us take another step forwards in getting to launch our proper balloon. We have also put together a video to show everybody what stage we are up to. This included a look at the hardware and payload camera test.

On top of this if there are any radio amateurs or shot wave listeners in that area that are interested in receiving or decoding RTTY data, we will write a post with the radio details.

Feel free to leave any comments with us.

Thanks
