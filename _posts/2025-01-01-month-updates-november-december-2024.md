## Nik - window decoration

Nik has laser-cut a hilbert curve that fits neatly as a window pane decoration. See more on Mastodon: <https://mastodon.social/@nnenov/113380244822759727>

## Nik - an LED device

Nik has also been learning PlatformIO. They used it to program an Arduino pro micro with an 8x32 matrix and the fastLED library.

> It's the first electronics thing I made which is not a sprawl of cables and just one single cable!

## Alex - a trip to soft lab

Alex has been exploring weaving and knitting structures, coding in knots, textile motifs as symbols, bitfields, rhythm, movement, liveness, and the internet of patterns on a residency in Eindhoven.

See more on Mastodon: <https://post.lurk.org/@yaxu/113485978426705451>

Also see a paper from a few years ago about a mini version, also by Alex <https://zenodo.org/records/3939176>.

## James - 3D printer in a backpack

James went to [SMRFF 2024](https://www.sanjaymortimerfoundation.org/smrrf24), a 3D printer festival in Manchester, for which they made a 3D printer which works in a backpack!

## Adam - organised electronics

Adam has been organising their electronics with 3D printed inserts.

## Tom - darning repairs

Tom bought a darning loom and used it to fix a hole in their jumper.

## A member - silicone D20 mould

One member designed and made a silicone icecube mould. The mould geometry was designed in CAD and from it, a mould for the silicone was created. This 3-part mould was 3D printed using PLA & PVB. The printed mould-mould was assembled and a 2-part foodsafe silicone was cast into it.

## Dave - CNC machine calibration

Dave from Desktop Machine Shop has been rebuilding a CNC machine...

> I have just rebuilt the Milo v1.5 CNC machine with some upgrades:
>
> - new more capable control board running RRF
> - 55v power supply for motors to increase speed and torque
> - new safety wiring so that SSRs are used to kill motor and spindle voltage without running high current through the e stop
>
> The machined star was just me testing out that everything was working after the rebuild. But it will be a Christmas decoration when I'm done. I'll drill a hole and pop some ribbon through it

## alifeee - CO2 monitoring

Finally, I set up a [SCD40](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD40) CO2 monitor in the space, and attached it to the old train sign.

See a lot more information in the relevant GitHub repositories:

- CO2 train sign: <https://github.com/sheffieldhackspace/co2-train-sign>
