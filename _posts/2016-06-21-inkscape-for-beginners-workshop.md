[![Inkscape Workshop in progress](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160619_211425.jpg)](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_20160619_211425.jpg)

Did you get to our Inkscape For Beginners workshop? We had fun afternoon with a mix of members and new people, learning the basics of Inkscape (2D graphics / design package, ideal for making lasercutter templates) and swapping tips and tricks. If there are other workshops you want to attend — or want us to run this one again! — let us know!

Even better, if there’s something fun or potentially useful that you can teach to a complete beginner, offer to run a workshop! SHHM are reliably an engaged and friendly audience, and teaching complete beginners is easier than you’d think.
