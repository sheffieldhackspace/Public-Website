## Visiting Nottinghack

> A few of us from the Hackspace drove to Nottingham last month, in part to watch
> [Hackers](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10428-hackers) at the
> [Savoy Cinema](https://savoyonline.co.uk/SavoyNottingham.dll/Home) in Nottingham.
> It was a 30th anniversary screening and we all wanted to watch it. We took the opportunity to visit
> [Nottingham Hackspace](https://nottinghack.org.uk/), and met up with a few members there.
>
> It's a lot bigger than our space, but shares a lot of ethos. I had fun looking around, especially at all the
> transport signs ;].
>
> No pictures, though, sorry!

### 3D printed coat hooks

### Making a historic belt with the CNC mill

> Designed in OpenSCAD, post processed using FreeCAD (with some pain), worked flawlessly until I miscalculated the clearance 🤦‍♂️
> 
> I successfully milled an element without breaking the drill bit.
> 
> Brass milled into a mock late XIV century decorative belt.

The manufacture:

### Environment monitoring at home

> I got myself some SEEED Xiao ESP32C6 and a Xiao Logger Hat and a 3.7V 500mAh lipo battery and I hope that I would be able to make this into a room state logger (temperature + humidity).
> 
> Looks like the ESP works and aside from some tiny weird sparks it is reliably 4 degrees hotter (offset subtracted in HA).

### Fixing my bike mudguard

> Something got stuck in my mudguard rods when I was cycling and completely ripped off the bottom part.
> As a "temporary fix" (that may last years), I widened an existing hole and bolted the fixing to that instead.

### Trying out ConnectedLittleBoxes

> [ConnectedLittleBoxes](https://www.connectedlittleboxes.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/connected-little-boxes/))
> is a project designed to make it easier for people to make arbitrary IOT devices.
> With an ESP8266, some buttons, some LEDs, and some JSON "code", you can make one box turn on the lights on another
> across the country, so long as both are connected to WiFi.
>
> I've been trying it out with two ESPs and you can see in the video that I press the button on the left one,
> and the right one reports this to the computer. I haven't got any better output devices yet (like LEDs),
> but I will order some. I might 3D print some cases for them.

### Environment monitoring of the Hackspace

> I set up a system ([source](https://github.com/sheffieldhackspace/hackspace-sensing-mqtt-listener))
> on the Hackspace MQTT network which listens to messages like…
> 
> ```mqtt
> SHHNoT/environment/room<X>/sensor<Y>/<measurement> <value>`
> ```
>
> …or with 'real' data…
> 
> ```mqtt
> SHHNoT/environment/room-d/sensor_ESP8266-SCD40-1/temperature 23.414
> ```
>
> …and saves that data to an instance of [InfluxDB2](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/) (time-series database)
> running in the space.
> That data can be queried and displayed nicely by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (data visualisation software),
> which is also running in the space.
> 
> Finally, I use [Info-Beamer](https://info-beamer.com/) (display management software) to
> occasionally show this Grafana dashboard on the monitor in the main room of the Hackspace,
> so everyone can see the current and previous environment data.
>
> In theory, anyone can add a sensor by simply making a device by pushing messages to MQTT with the right format.
> A couple of other people have done this already — I've also
> [published the code](https://github.com/sheffieldhackspace/hackspace-sensing) I am using to flash ESP devices
> with various sensors.

Here are some sensors (moiture, CO2/temperature/humidity)

### Assembling a mini macro-pad

> Last year Pimoroni [gave us a box of goodies](/month-updates-july-2024/#we-opened-up-a-gift-box-from-pimoroni).
> This month, I found a [Keybow Mini](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow-mini-3-key-macro-pad-kit)
> and assembled it. It was pretty fun to make, and I made some
> [custom firmware](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/notes/assembling-the-pi-bow-mini-a-small-macro-pad/)
> to allow more than 3 keys of input from the 3-key keyboard.
>
> I… can't say I've used it much since making it, but it was still fun.

### Connecting old transport signs to the Internet

> For a few years [I've enjoyed](https://alifeee.co.uk/favourites/#hardware%20hacking)
> hacking into old transport signs. This month, I've been trying to make some better hardware to connect to them
> than my flimsy breadboard/dupont monstrosities

The messy connections I've been making so far

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

One of the transport signs I've been messing with

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

Some of the old internal electronics of the sign that I have repurposed

The sign connected to Ethernet, letting me send messages from a nearby computer

The "better" connector that I've been trying to make. I think the soldering is OK.

### Creating a space-state visualiser

> More things for the monitor! With the help of Nik's beautiful visuals, I made
> [a system](https://github.com/sheffieldhackspace/space-state-visualiser) which runs a Python server to:
> 
> - listen to MQTT messages and update an internal state object
> - send this state to anyone who requests it via HTTP (plain or over websockets)
> - send a webpage which will live-update with the latest state
>
> Watch it in action in the video below, where someone opens the door in the common room and it shows such on the monitor.

### Creating a virtual tour of the Hackspace

> [Downpour](https://downpour.games/) is a really neat tool for making easy-to-understand, easy-to-make, interactive games.
> I've used it for [all sorts](https://downpour.games/~alifeee) of fun little things.
> This month I made a little prototype [tour of Sheffield Hackspace](https://downpour.games/~alifeee/what-s-inside-sheffield-hackspace)
> with it. It was fun running around and snapping pics. It was less fun drawing the same blue/purple box for the 30th time.
>
> You can try it out right here:

### Contributing to Movary, a movie tracking website

> For a while I was trying to find something like [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) which would
> let me log movies I wanted to watch, or had watched, but without being locked in to one company or system
> (Letterboxd uses data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) but doesn't provide the cross-reference TMDB
> movie ID when you export your data, making it much less usable, horrible!)
> 
> I found out about [Movary](https://github.com/leepeuker/movary/), which is a self-hosted movie tracker.
> I wanted to find something with ActivityPub support, but I could only find [NeoDB](https://neodb.net/),
> which was a bit too powerful for my needs. I set up [my own instance](https://movary.alifeee.net/users/alifeee)
> of Movary a couple months ago, and have been adding a few small features and fixes which I contribute back to the
> project. I think it's neat :]

### Decorating Gaslands cars

> Made one of my first Gaslands cars out of the Hot Wheels cars I cracked open a week or so ago - the pillar drill was perfect for boring out those rivets, so I can remove the "glass", repaint the whole car and interior too. Oh, and of course, I had to add some  spiky wheels and maniacal freaks who are fighting for dear life in the American wastelands!

### Rocketry

> Several of us have been getting into model rocketry, we attended a Midland Rocketry Club launch. I have been working on a few rocket builds including a pyramid which i cut on the laser cutter, epoxied together and painted with a metallic gloss paint which gives a great effect in the sun.

### Commodore 64 Re-PCB

> This is my Commodore 64 Re-PCB Project.  After dusting off my childhood Commodore64, I discovered there were a few issues with it.
> After swapping out the problematic memory, I started tracking down a logic issue.  Unfortunately, the revision of the Commodore 64 motherboard I had was prone to lifting tracks and solder flowing under the solder mask. Fortunately, the Board Folk created a reverse-engineered  C64 PCB with those issues fixed and built to modern standards.
> I rebuilt the Commodore onto the latest revision of the "Long board"  I fitted all new passives, switches, cartridge slot and controller ports, and fitted all of the custom chips and logic from my original C64.  Turns out it wasn't a logic issue at all, but a fault with one of the components on the old board as the problem didn't move across to the new board.
> 
> So although it's a new mainboard, the heart is still the same as my 1986 original.  It's been a lot of fun, and a lot of solder.
