The Sheffield Hardware Hackers and Makers now has an official logo, with thanks to John. Over the weekend he created us a fantastically, well thought out and prestigious logo. We can now put a name to our face and start to show who we are.

I think that we can all agree that a large laser cut version of the logo is on the TO DOâ€¦. and maby even with some key ringsâ€¦ ðŸ™‚

Thanks John!

Donâ€™t forget! There is an Open Lab Planned for Saturday the 15th in the Refab Lab at Access Space.
