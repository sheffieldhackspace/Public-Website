So… With preparation for our High Altitude Balloon launch well underway, we thought that we would let the community know what we where up to on this challenge.

The bits that we are working on at the minuet include:

– The telemetry hardware (the radio transmitter sending GPS data ect)  
– Selecting a suitably sized gondola (the payload box)  
– Constructing a parachute  
– Experimenting with different methods of reviving the telemetry data

The telemetry transmitter module is now in the stage where it is being made more permanent. It has been soldered on to some strip board with a whole host of components, including a GPS and pressure sensor.

We have been able to acquire some various shaped polystyrene boxes for gondolas. We just need to decide witch one will be the most suitable to carry our payload.

We have also been very lucky to have a group member construct us a parachute for helping the payload get back down to the ground in one pice.
