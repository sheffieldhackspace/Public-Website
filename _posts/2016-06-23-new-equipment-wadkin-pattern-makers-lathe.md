We’re getting our newest toy set up here at SHHM. We’re being gifted the long-term loan of a Wadkin woodworking lathe, that accepts workpieces up to 7 feet long and, in principle, over a yard in diameter. It’s up and running in our new cellar space, we just need to get hold of some PPE to use it safely. There should be some workshops coming up, covering things like safe useage, basic shapes, bowl turning, etc. We can’t wait!

As ever, if you’re not a member yet but are interested in using our workshops for your projects, or want to learn to make stuff with a friendly crowd, get in touch or just turn up to one of our scheduled meetings and say hi.
