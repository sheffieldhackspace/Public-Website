## Workshops

As well as our [Dice-Casting](/dice-casting/) workshop, we have had a workshop about making personal websites, and we're soon due one about [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/).

Keep an eye on the workshop-wall in the space, and in the Discord for upcoming events!

## Dave - machining toe clamps

> Slowly making myself a few toe clamps. I was doing them in aluminium but decided to try my luck in steel.
>
> Essentially ran the same tool path but swapping to a 3 flute end mill and it came out within +-0.05 ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°

## alifeee - fixing my bike mudguard bracket

Bill graciously helped me measure, cut, and bend a new bracket to hold my mudguards in place. For a while now, it's been rattling as I bike down the street (a good stand-in for not ringing your bike bell), but more annoyingly, the panniers keep falling into the wheels.

Hopefully, this incredibly shiny new piece stops some of that.

## Jon - creating board game "puzzle boxes"

> Some of you may have seen me in the space spending forever making "Puzzle Boxes" for my wedding... Well I'm pleased to say that they are finally complete!
>
> As far as our guests are aware, they are the table name markers and also designed to hold a bottle of wine to function as gift boxes for various people afterwards.
>
> HOWEVER, in the middle of the speeches we will ask guests to lift the boxes from the base, because inside the box is where we have hidden their wedding favours!
>
> Unfortunately for them, they will find the boxes locked with a combination padlock.
>
> In the bases are hidden a series of puzzles, which when solved will give them the padlock code in order to open the main box.

## Nathen - laser-cutting an arcade stick from acrylic

> From a pile of laser cut acrylic, I have a custom arcade stick. Just playing with that stupid stuff people put on their windscreen as a design for the stick.

## alifeee - sewing repairs

I used the sewing machine to both fix some bag straps for a tote bag, and to hem some trousers.

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

## alifeee - creating a laser-cut map

I used the laser cutter to make a gift map-frame of a [journey to Europe](https://alifeee.co.uk/europe-trips/) of mine and someone's.

First, I downloaded a Shapefile of the world's geography from <https://www.naturalearthdata.com/>, converted it to an SVG with <https://mapshaper.org/>, and cropped it to an appropriate size.

Then, I collected traces of the trains, buses, and boats we'd taken following [my own instructions](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/notes/how-to-get-a-gps-trace-of-train-and-boat-journeys/), and then overlayed the two SVGs, and had to hand-stretch them to match up properly.

Finally, I played around with laser cutter settings with a smaller image to get a nice engrave depth and tested different types of wood. I was also playing around with painting it, but I think the unpainted version looks nicer.

## alifeee - jailbreaking a kindle

It doesn't take much to install custom software on a kindle. There are [guides out there](https://kindlemodding.org/) and a [wiki about it](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/K4_Index). Doing so lets you install [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/), an open source document viewer for e-readers, with many more features and accessibility options than the kindle's default reader.

## James - creating a smart home letterbox

> A custom arm for ZigBee door sensor on letter box.
>
> Using Home Assistant it provides a push notification (using Pushover) when the post has arrived.
>
> As a bit of ironic fun, I set the alert sound to the old AOL "You've Got Mail" sound.

You can download the files on <https://www.printables.com/model/1291168-indoor-letter-mail-post-box-zigbee-wifi-door-senso>!

## Adam - creating an oscillator

> I have made myself an oscillator using DaisySeed DSP. "Made" is an overstatement as I basically merged 2 examples (an oscillator and how to use a pot with the device).
>
> It now lives on a fancy breadboard.

> Trying to learn cable lacing. Annoyingly the "waxed" cable I bought isn't waxed and has some stretch to it.

## alifeee - making a ribbon cable to breadboard connector

For an old project ([Hull Bus Sign](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/hull-bus-sign/)), I wanted to revamp the hardware, so I made these breadboard connectors. Beforehand, I'd haphazardly soldered some wires to the back of a circuitboard, which were bound to come off.

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

## alifeee - testing laser-cut stamps

I got a few ink pads as a gift a few months ago, so I've been playing with laser-cutting stamps. The first attempt was with MDF, which worked "o.k.".

Then, I bought some laser-cuttable rubber for Â£5 per sheet from <https://laserply.co.uk/>, and tried that, which worked pretty great.
