**This Months Meet Up**

This meet up on the 29th of July, we had a man from BBC Radio Sheffiels come in and interview people about 3D printing. This was to try and get an understanding of what 3D printing is, how it works and how it has progressed over the years.

It was broadcast at 6:50 AM and in more detail at 7:30 AM. The show is available on iPlayer.

The 6:50 AM part is available [hear](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01c7pnt) at 1 hour 50 minuets.

Then the 7.30 AM part is available [hear](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01c7pnw) at 1 hour and 3 minuets.
