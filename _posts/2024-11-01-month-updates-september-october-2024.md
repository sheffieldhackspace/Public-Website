## Nik - interference waves

Nik has been making impressive visual art for a projection mapping showcase.

> Interference Waves is a 1 minute experimental audiovisual animation created for the Minute MAPP Monreal projection mapping showcase, part of the annual MAPP festival in Montreal, screened on 26 Sept 2024.

## Nik - pen plotter

Nik has also been experimenting with a new (to him) pen plotter, a Roland CAMM-1 PNC-1000.

## Stuart - relay

> This is a prototype of a device to count attendance at a non-league football ground. The relay is to control the turnstile and let people in.
>
> Hereâ€™s a video with the relay working and the LED display showing a count of how many times the button has been pressed, i.e., how many people are inside.

## new blinds and new stairs

New stairs have been put in place between the engine room and main room. As well, the blinds in the main room are now controllable automatically.

> There are 5 blinds, there are 5 sliders.  Push a corresponding slider up, the blind goes up; push a slider down, the blind goes down.
>
> Above the sliders is a secret red button, push it and see what happens.

## Alfie - a vinyl cut sign

This month I had my first go on the vinyl cutter, to make a sign for me and my housemate. It's very satisfying to use, so much that I took a timelapse of it cutting my sign.

## Richard - straightening wires

Richard made a video about how to straighten cables that has gained an impressive amount of popularity online for being useful and to-the-point.
