Exciting times here at SHHM! We’re moving into our new space at the [Portland Works](http://www.portlandworks.co.uk/). It’s an amazing building that’s been central to Sheffield’s industrial history, and is now run as “a community owned home for traditional crafts and creative arts”. We’ll fit in well!

We have big plans for this space: as a workshop for your projects, a classroom to learn new skills and techniques, and a social hub for hackers, makers and geeks in Sheffield. For now, though, we’re stripping it back to the bricks and making a blank canvas to work from. Everyone is very welcome to join us, but for the next few weeks while we’re building you should expect to get dirty!
