A few of the things weâ€™ve been up to in the hackspace over the past week or two: Sewable arduinos (floras) and crochet, woodworking on the new lathe, silverwork on the jewellery bench, soldering up some electronics projects, painting the walls for our cellar expansion while planning the next builds, and lots of coding, writing and chatter.

Want to meet a friendly group of makers, whether to work on your own projects or as a beginner to learn new skills? Call in to one of our open sessions to see the workshop, say hi, and learn about how the group works.
