Designed and built at the [Sheffield Hackspace](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/) using an arduino and bits and pieces of things that you might find lying around in your own home…

Here’s the setup:

An arduino (pro mini) for controlling the SG-90 servo motor  
An ESP8266 for wifi access and neopixel control  
A piece of gutter and downpipe for the main body  
A plastic dome sourced from a solar powered garden lamp  
An Aldi’s peanut butter jam jar lid (crucial)  
Other bits and bobs scrounged from various unwanted poundland items

If you think this is cool wait until you see the boats!
