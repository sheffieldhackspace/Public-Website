## R

### Custom sunglasses

R found some glasses frames, and some too-big sunglass lenses, so shaped the latter to the former and ended up with some new sunglasses.

## Rich

### Laser-cut Skadis board

> My laser cut Skadis board is finally up. I think the natural MDF looks is quite good. Plastic offsets are 3d printed of course

## Tom

### Gauges

> As part of an ongoing project to create an interactive display based around the CubeSatSim that I have been lent I thought it would be nice to display the Solar Panel and Battery voltages in a way that was more than just 'numbers on a screen'.
>
> Initially I thought I'd use something like the analog dial gauges, either the voltmeter or ammeter variants.

## Nik

### Pinhole camera

Nik had a go at making easy swap pinhole lenses to experiment with:

#### The lenses

### Adding bench supports

two videos from a [recent blog post](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/2025/08/bench-stabilisation/) – check out the difference in wobbliness before and after I added supports.

### Painting a wall-board

After getting help attaching a board to the wall, I primed and painted it in what has accidentally become the "hackspace motif". Over time I hope to put some of the craft tools up on there.

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

### Toying with the bus sign

I turned on the [Hull Bus Sign](https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/hull-bus-sign/) for the duration of a gamejam, where we made the game "[Penumbra](https://jman9092.itch.io/penumbra)" in 48 hours.

### Making a hat better

I needed a hat for a holiday. I found one, but it looked ugly. So I added a nice ribbon to it instead.

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

### Creating a light up logo

I found a bunch of bases for these "laser-cut LED lamps" at a car boot, so I've been cutting my own designs for them. Check out the on- and off- picture of the Sheffield Hackspace logo.

<figure class="gallery" markdown="1">

### Setting up environment monitoring

With another member, I set up a Raspberry Pi with InfluxDB and Grafana, for recording and displaying data from environment monitors. I also set up an environment monitor that measures carbon dioxide levels.

There's more information on the [monitoring wiki page](https://wiki.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/members/projects/monitoring).

## Adam

### Blackstar Amp

> I have picked up Blackstar Amped 1, which is a 100W amplifier with a USB-C audio interface, but also line out / speaker out.
> But what is VERY COOL, is that it has 2× +9V outputs for pedals. The power source is also very quiet.
> As a bonus I have 3d printed myself a stand that allows me to add a front pass-through of all relevant I/O ports from back of the unit.
> In the end this has greatly reduced the footprint of things on my desk.
>
> As a bonus for the bonus. I've generated STL-s for this stand using OpenSCAD,
> which is an open source piece of software that allows one to render 3D objects as code.
> It is fairly inconsistent with commands and some things aren't as polished as Autodesk Fusion.
> However, it has a bonus of being able to keep the fairly simple code in the Github and not having to pay for it.
>
> <https://github.com/dredzik/blackstar-amped1-port-stand>

### Food thermometer hacking

> Food thermometer no longer needs an app and an account in the cloud.

### Food processor repair

> How long does it take food graded grease to become solid? 14 years.
> We've disassembled a kMix, ordered replacement parts, and will be spending tomorrow trying to remove all that grease from the insides.
>
> But also: You can still get all the replacement parts for this 14 year old kMix, and they're dead cheap.

> 2 days later, the kMix mechanism is completely dismantled and all of its old grease has been removed.
> I am now letting it vent out all the petrol, before I will re-grease and assemble it again.
> 
> The only souvenir I got is the main cogwheel that I replaced just in case as it was advised online. It works.
> It stopped grinding and the faint grease compacting noise on the video is now gone as well.

### Parametric EQ

> Parametric EQ became an actual product prototype. The white square is to hide the branding, as it is not yet decided nor registered.
> I have ordered the case from Tayda Electronics and I managed to make everything aligned correctly with version 1.
>
> I have since been ironing out a lot of kinks:
>
> * Can I get a footswitch of the right length, so I don't have to adjust the inner stopper with every pedal? (Yes)
> * Can I speed up assembly of the footswitch connection? (Yes, I used JST XH and bought precrimped wired) 
> * Can I create a soldering jig to align potentiometers and LED fast? (Yes)
> * Can I get an LED stand-offs, so I can solder them the right distance from the PCB each time and improve their rigidity? (Yes)]
>
> BTW: Temple Audio Pedalboards have quick mount plates that you glue to the back of your guitar effects so that you can easily attach them to the board.
> Which is fine if you are very precise with aligning them, or you're not bothered by them being uneven.
> I on the other hand, have printed a set of alignment tools.

### Tube Screamer Topology Prototype

> Tube Screamer topology prototype.
> I have moved away from 2 transistors + 2 opamps, to 4 opamps design, so I can put the whole effect in one TL074.
> The 2 transistors were there as an input and output buffers so it was fairly easy to switch to OpAmps with gain 1 without change in the voicing.
>
> I am now adjusting values of some high / low pass filters on the way more to my liking, and later I will mod the tone section a bit.
