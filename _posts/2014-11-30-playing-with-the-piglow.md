Playing with the [PiGlow](http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/piglow)

Having purchased the Raspbery Pi B+, I decided to try it out with the PiGlow from Pimoroni. As a new user of Python, I downloaded the examples from Ben Lebherz (benleb), available from GitHub, in order to get the PiGlow going. The instructions made sure that the Pi was set up correctly, and soon the red LEDs began lighting up. I then began editing the code myself, to get a feel for Python and soon all LEDs were blinking, pulsing and the arms/legs coming on and off in rotation. The PiGlow can even be controlled using Scratch (thanks to [@rabid\_inventor](https://twitter.com/rabid_inventor) and Simon Walters at [simplesi.net](http://simplesi.net/) for assisting me with this).
