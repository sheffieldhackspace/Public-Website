<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans Condensed;">A great weekend was had by all as multiple members of SHH&amp;M went down to Loseley Park for EMF2016. Our entrepid woodworker, AJ, went ahead of the rest of us to build the sink frames, back of the bar and multiple other items ahead of over 1400 people decending for a weekend of camping. However, as should be expected from a group of hackers and makers camping, electricity and high speed internet were essential amenities. We had our own Village, complete with flag, and took along some Go-Boxes and Bugs’s pancake engraver to show off (blog to follow!). </span>

<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans Condensed;">Events over the weekend included numerous talks from lockpicking to film special effects and latest updates from CERN to magic tricks and illusions. There was also the opportunity to make a wide range of things such as a titanium spork, a patchwork pin cushion and a pin hole camera. Evening events included film showings, the infamous Robot Arms with NottyHacks Barbot, a light maze and FirePong – yep, ping pong with fire! There was also a giant blow up rabbit which you could change the colour of by tweeting a colour! </span>

<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans Condensed;">All the talks are available to watch on You Tube if you feel want to catch-up with anything.</span>

<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans Condensed;">A one day event is planned for next year, with the next EMF camp due in 2018. If this year is anything to go by, both should be highly recommended!</span>
