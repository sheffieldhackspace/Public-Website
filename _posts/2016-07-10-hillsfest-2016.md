We had a good time at Hillsfest this year! Lots of friends and new faces with stalls in the Makerâ€™s Dome, and we really enjoyed chatting with everyone who came up to make wollen bobbles (Thanks to Jo and Sarah for running that!), and ask about all the 3D printed, lasercut and otherwise member-built things we had on display.

We know a lot of you signed up to the mailing list, and a lot more plan to drop into one of our [scheduled sessions](https://www.sheffieldhackspace.org.uk/wordpress/calendar/) at [our workshop in Portland Works](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Sheffield+Hardware+Hackers+and+Makers+(Sheffield+Hackspace)/@53.3697669,-1.4783409,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x487982886c6d27bd:0x8d13495e90196a17!8m2!3d53.3697637!4d-1.4739635). Come along! See the space, chat with our other members and find out what your local hackspace can do for you.
