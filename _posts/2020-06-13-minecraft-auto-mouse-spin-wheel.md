When you are building creations in Minecraft, sometimes you need to have random blocks placed down from you hotbar. With this little program created with the help from Simon, (Thanks Simon), you now don’t have to manually spin your mouse wheel to achieve this.

Just run the python script, after checking you have the prerequisites installed (python 3 and pynput) and press ‘y’ to spin the wheel and ‘Esc’ to stop.

Link to the gitlab page.

Happy gaming,
